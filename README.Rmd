The goal of `cecelia` is to simplify image analysis for immunologists and integrate
static and live cell imaging with flow cytometry data. The package primarily builds upon
[`napari`](https://napari.org) and [`shiny`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). Our aim was 
to combine shiny's graph plotting engine with napari's image display.

__This package is pre-alpha__

## Installation

__This package currently only works on Unix systems.__ We have a Docker version to support other
systems if necessary, so do open an issue if that is needed.

You can install the development version of cecelia like so:
```r
if (!require("remotes", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("schienstockd/cecelia")
```

For first time users, you will need to define base directory where
configuration files, models and the shiny app will be stored. `cecelia` depends
on a python environment which needs to be created. There are multiple options available
depending on how you would like to use the app:

- `image` For image analysis on Desktop

- `image-nogui` For image processing without GUI

- `flow` For flow cytometry analysis

```r
library(cecelia)

# install all required R libraries
cciaRequirements()

# setup cecelia directory
cciaSetup("~/path/to/cecelia")

# create conda environment
cciaCondaCreate()
# cciaCondaCreate(envType = "image-nogui") # to use without gui
# cciaCondaCreate(envType = "flow") # for flow based only

# download models for deep-learning segmentation
cciaModels()

# create app
cciaCreateApp()
```

You have to adjust the parameters in `~/path/to/cecelia/custom.yml` to your system.
You need download/install:

- [`bftools`](https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/6.7.0/artifacts/bftools.zip)

- [`bioformats2raw`](https://github.com/glencoesoftware/bioformats2raw/releases/download/v0.4.0/bioformats2raw-0.4.0.zip)

- [`ImageJ`](https://imagej.net/imagej-wiki-static/Fiji/Downloads) if using Spot segmentation

For `ImageJ`, activate the following update sites:

- IJPB-plugins

- 3D-ImageJ-Suite

- Bio-Formats

```yml
default:
  dirs:
    bftools: "/Applications/BFTools"
    bioformats2raw: "/Applications/glencoe/bioformats2raw-0.3.0"
    projects: "/your/project/directory/"
  volumes:
    SSD: "/your/ssd/directory/"
    home: "~/"
    computer: "/"
  python:
    conda:
      env: "r-cecelia-env"
      source:
        env: "r-cecelia-env"
  imagej:
    path: "/Applications/Fiji.app/Contents/MacOS/ImageJ-macosx"
```

## Image analysis general workflow

```r
library(cecelia)
cciaUse("~/path/to/cecelia", initJupyter = TRUE)
cciaRunApp(port = 6860)
```

1. Create a Project for `static` or `live`analysis.

2. Images have to be imported as `OME-ZARR`. Choose `Import Images` and create an `Experimental Set`.
It is helpful if all images within this set have the same colour combinations.
Add Images. Select all images you want to import and choose `OME-ZARR`.
Select the required `pyramid scales` and `run` the task.

3. Select `Image Metadata` and click `Load Metadata` to load the channel information.
You can assign channels either one by one by selecting a channel and `Specify Value` > `Assign Value`.
Alternatively, you can give a list of channels in the box and click `Assing channels`.
You can add further experimental attributes by `Create Attribute` and adding
respecive values for the individual images.

4. Select `Cell Segmentation` to segment your images.

5. Select `Population Gating` to use flow cytometry like gating to define populations.
Select `Populations Clustering` to use cluster algorithms to define populations.

6. Select `Spatial Analysis` to define spatial neighbourhoods, detect clustering cells or
detect contact between cells.

## Flow Cytometry general workflow

```r
library(cecelia)
cciaUse("~/path/to/cecelia", initJupyter = FALSE)
cciaRunApp(port = 6860)
```

1. Create a Project for `flow`analysis.

2. `FCS` files can be imported either from raw or other sources such as `FlowJo`.
They will converted into an [`Anndata`](https://anndata.readthedocs.io) to perform clustering and
a [`GatingSet`](https://github.com/RGLab/flowWorkspace) to perform manual gating.

3. The rest of the pipeline is the same as for image analysis.

## Running workflows from `RMarkdown`

All Processing available in the app can be done from `RMarkdown`  as well.
Every image is `ReactivePersistentObject` whose state is saved in an `RDS` file
and is `reactive` in a `shiny` app context. These objects can be loaded and manipulated
as such:

```r
library(cecelia)

# set test variables
pID <- "pEdOoZ"   # project ID
versionID <- 2    # version ID
uID <- "tPl6da"   # image ID

# init ccia object
cciaObj <- initCciaObject(
  pID = pID, uID = uID, versionID = versionID, initReactivity = FALSE
)

funParams <- list(
  pyramidScale = 4,
  dimOrder = "",
  createMIP = FALSE,
  rescaleImage = FALSE
)

cciaObj$runTask(
  funName = "importImages.omezarr",
  funParams = funParams,
  runInplace = TRUE
)
```

## Creating plots

One aim of `ceelia` is to provide plotting over the GUI with `shiny`.
We are currently in the process of testing processing data. This part
of the app is less developed as we learn which plots and statistics are relevant.
Plotting is currently done in `RMarkdown` files but we are planning to
incorporate these into the app.

```r
# init experimental set
cciaObj <- initCciaObject(
  pID = pID, uID = "U7LRc9", versionID = versionID, initReactivity = FALSE
)

# get image attributes
exp.info <- cciaObj$summary(withSelf = FALSE, fields = c("Attr"))

# get cluster populations
popDT <- cciaObj$popDT(popType = "clust", includeFiltered = TRUE)

# now you can plot this as a normal data.table
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(popDT, aes(centroid_x, centroid_y, color = pop)) +
  theme_classic() +
  geom_point(aes(color = as.factor(clusters)), size = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(.~uID, scales = "free")
```
